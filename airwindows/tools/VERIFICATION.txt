VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

As far as I can tell, Chris does not keep old versions archived. There's just what you can get off of his site right now.
So that means if this package is lagging behind what he has on his site, the checksums won't match.

Otherwise you can just do:

checksum "WinVST64s.zip" -t=sha256

and compare.
